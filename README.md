# TesserAkt

[Objects](https://bitbucket.org/AdrianArtacho/workspace/projects/TESSER) within the *TESSER* environment are designed for real-time interaction. This environement is developed and mantained by [Adrian Artacho](https://bitbucket.org/AdrianArtacho/).

# To-Do

- [Tesser_cmd] reading from a spreadsheet ([download-sheet]), specific combinations of midinotes cause a specific midi command out. For example: *Midinotes 60 61 63* (played simulteneusly) change the */PRESET* (CC21) to *5*.

- [Tesser_recall] a device that could save gestures as presets (and could receive them dynamically from the [Tesser_gesture] device), and do so in their original form, reversed backwards, inverted along a /centernote, inverted along the gesture's axis, 2x tempo 0.5x tempo (Zeitlupe)... etc. The device should ALSO read the contents of the current midi clip playing on its track, as an alternative way of entering gesture info / perform operations on that midi material.
